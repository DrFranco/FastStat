FastStat
========
A quick and efficient way of taking realtime stats for sports (starting w/ WP)
What It Does
============
This mobile application will take the time out of writing stats using pencil and paper, which occasionally takes longer than the action of play itself.
How To Build It
===
To build this app on a simulated or actual device, you will need XCode 6 or later. Download the files included here and open the FastStat.xcodeproj file. Once in Xcode, you can select the device you wish to simulate or download to, then by pressing the play or by pressing CMD + R. Then you can start taking down stats!
